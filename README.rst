What makes a beautiful street, or a pleasant neighborhood? Maybe that’s hard to define, but can you tell a beautiful place from somewhere that’s not so hot?

Beautiful Streets is a project from `OpenPlans <http://openplans.org/civicworks>`_. It’s an experiment: we’re trying out a different way to evaluate places, called pairwise surveys, as popularized by the fantastic `All Our Ideas <http://AllOurIdeas>`_. We’re also testing out some neat interface ideas, and learning about the use of Street View in evaluating places for urban planning projects.  

With your help, we’ll compare 200 randomly-selected streets in Philly and ask which one in each pair is more beautiful.  We expect this experiment will produce some neat data, which you’ll be able to download here soon. 

Try it out, and let us know what you think via `@OpenPlans <http://twitter.com/openplans>`_ or `here <http://openplans.org/contact>`_.
